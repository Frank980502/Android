# UL Timetable
It's a timetable application for UL students.
Due to the courses in UL are diverse and complex, with flexible class time and place. It is difficult for students to memorize the curriculum schedule completely, and they can only carry the paper curriculum schedule with them, which is very inconvenient. In addition, international students need to choose courses independently, and most of them can only choose courses in a tedious and complicated way such as manual course arrangement, which is time-consuming and laborious. 
This application based on actual needs, and the Android operating system, using the Firebase technology to provide a mobile platform for students in University of Limerick, students can choose modules and check the course information at any time, it makes time management and curriculum management more convenient.
